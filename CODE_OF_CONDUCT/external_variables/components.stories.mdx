# Component variables


## Using theme variables inside components
we almost always need to use some global variables to our components, but how we do that? I have to documente this use for my component?

Inside your component you **must** whenever it makes sense, use theme variables, that way on changin theme variables all compoenents changes toggether. To make use of they you don't neet to import nothing, the variables is global, so just use it:

✅ Do:
```css
button {
  color: var(--theme-my-theme-var);
}
```

❌ Don't do:
```css
button {
  color: var(--theme-my-theme-var, black);
}
```

You don't neet to set a default value when using theme variables, theme variables ir guaranteed to be always defined.

You don't need to documentation at your component which theme variable you are using, just make sure that you are using the theme variable correctly and if needed change the global theme variable description.

✅ Do:
```
use --theme-dark-txt to set some text color in your component
use --theme-medium-shape in some medium shape in your component
```

❌ Don't do:
```css
use --theme-dark-txt to set some surface color
use --theme-medium-shape in some large or small shape
```

## Exporting variable inside components
Some times our component have a specific style that will be nice if user could set. For this we could set some css variables inside the component, instead of creating more and more global variables, that will be used only in one component. But how create then? How documentate?

### Creating

You can create especific variables for your component too, like:
```css
.my-component-class-wrapper {
  --my-var: var(--szot-my-var, blue);

  button {
    color: var(--my-var);
  }
}
```
**Note: Always declare all external variables at the beginning of your css.**

**External variable must contains the prefix `szot`.**

If you need some internal variables just declare them at the beginning of your css, but above the comment `internal variables only`, and after external variables.

Note: Don't use SCSS variables, unless for some specific internal cases that you don't see some day they being exported to theme variables.

Note: if you use some ionic component, translate our external variables to theirs theme variables.

### Documenting

If you create some external variables, you must documentate it. To do that just create and MDX story inside you component folder, and document as needed. You can use a table with the variable name, the default value e some description, and add some examples.

The important here is that users of this package know that this modification is possible and how to do it.

Here a sort video showing how to do:
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src={ extVariableVideo } type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
