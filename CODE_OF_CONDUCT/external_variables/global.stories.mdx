# Global theme variables

The project contains some global variables that is defined at `src/styles/variables`.

These files set internal variables based on theme variables with default values.

**In your component use just the internal theme variables.**

Internal theme variables are based on external variables, and must have the prefix `theme`, like `--theme-font-size`.

The external variables, must have the prefix `szot`, like `--szot-font-size`.

You can create especific variables for your component too, see [Theme/Components variables](?path=/story/code-of-conduct-theme-componets--page)

If you need some internal global variables (that is not a theme variable) just declare in the same context file, but above the comment `internal variables only`.

Note: Don't use SCSS variables, unless for some specific internal cases that you don't see some day they being exported to theme variables.

Note: if you use some ionic component, translate our theme variables to theirs theme variables.
