# What is

A form field is a component made to be used with the form component. In this page we will list some things that all form fields must have.

## List

- [ ] consistent props interface;
- [ ] consistent css variables interface;
- [ ] error validation;
- [ ] integrate with form context and allow the component you're creating to be used alone;
- [ ] have stories for:
  - custom css variables
  - values changed programmatically
  - the list of css variables, with a description and the default value (may have examples too, like the theme stories)
- [ ] the interface to set the value must allow svelte "bind" directive and have similar behavior to the corresponding native HTML tag in svelte
