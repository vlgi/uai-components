# Stack

This project was build with [svelte kit packaging](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/packaging), and
storybook.

This project is divided in two, the contents of `src/routes` is the public-facing stuff; `src/lib`
contains your app's internal library, that can be published on npm.

## Recommended IDE Setup

Use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the
[extensions recommended for the workspace](./.vscode/extensions.json). Make sure the
[settings](./.vscode/settings.json) aren't obscured by your user settings in any way.

## Setting up the environment

1. Instal `docker`
2. If in windows install `WSL2`
3. Run `make up` to get inside the container
4. Inside de container run `npm install`

## Make commands

```bash
# Docker commands
make up     # Start the container and get inside the app container
make down   # Stop the container
make enter  # Get inside the container (useful to get more than one terminal inside the app container)
```

## Running

```bash
# For development
npm run dev         # Runs the website app with hot reloading
npm run storybook   # Runs storybook in hot reloading mode

# For deployment
npm run build           # Builds the package and website
npm run package         # Builds the package into the dist folder
npm run storybook-build # Builds a static storybook site into storybook-static

# Variant
npm run package:watch   # Builds the package in watch mode
```

## Testing

```bash
# run once variants
npm run test # Runs tests in *.test.ts files

# watch variants (will rerun changed tests automatically)
npm run test:watch # Runs tests in *.test.ts files
```

## Linting and Formatting

The project comes with a pre-loaded eslint configuration, prettier and svelte-check. The commands
are as follows:

```bash
npm run format # Formats all files using prettier
npm run lint-fix # Fixes all autofixable issues detected by eslint
npm run format-check # Checks if it's formatter correctly using prettier
npm run lint # Checks if the files are okay according to eslint
npm run check # Checks if the files are okay according to svelte-check
```

## Testing everything

You may want to run all the tests to check if the project is following the formatter, linter and has
no failing tests. You can do that with the command `npm run check-all`
