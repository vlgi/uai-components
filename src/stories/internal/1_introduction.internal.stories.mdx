# Introduction

The internal documentation is made to guide the developers at the creation of the UAI components
package.

The main goal is documentate the internal patterns to be followed.

Can be used to document internal components stuff too. Internal documentation will not be
externalized on the package documentation page. To do that just create the stories file with name
like `anything.internal.stories.mdx` or `anything.internal.stories.ts`.
