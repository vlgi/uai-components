# Introduction

The project contains some global css variables that is defined at `src/lib/styles/variables`.

These files set internal variables based on theme variables with default values.

**In your component use just the internal theme variables.**

Internal theme variables are based on external variables, and must have the prefix `theme`, like
`--theme-font-size`.

The external variables, must have the prefix `uai`, like `--uai-font-size`.

You can create especific variables for your component too, see
[Components Css variables](?path=/docs/internal-documentation-variables-and-themes-components-css-variables--docs)

Note: Don't use SCSS variables, unless for some specific internal cases that you don't see some day
they being exported to theme variables.
