# Introduction

Actions is an feature from svelte: https://svelte.dev/tutorial/actions.

Actions feature isn't well typed, so we create a global type as workaround on
`src/actionsCustomEvents.d.ts`. For this workaround works your actions must trigger events that name
starts with `action` prefix.

You can create actions for your components inside their folder, but here on `src/lib/actions` we
salve common actions, that can be used for all components.

If you create an action, generic or specific to your component, please document it.
