# Form Docs

This component is a wrapper to use like html form:

```jsx
<Form>
  <Input
    type="text"
    name="my-imput"
  />
</Form>
```

Within it some form fields can be used, but to have full integration they must be our custom form
fields, not html tags. That's because this wrapper sets up a context to communicate with child
components and automate validation and fetching values for you.

You can find the full list of the components that can be used inside this wrapper on
<<<<<<<< HEAD:src/lib/components/Form/Form.stories.mdx
`Components/FormFields`.

**NOTE: Inside a Form component, every formfield MUST have the name attribute defined, and MUST be
unique, inside this Form component.**

## Submit the form

When submit is triggered 3 things happens:

- Validate all fields, and if someone is invalid we show the error on the field.
- If some field is invalid we will scroll, to show the invalid field.
- If all fields are valid, the `Form` fire the on:submit event.

You can submit the form in 3 ways, described bellow.

### With our `<Button type="submit">` inside the `Form` component.

```jsx
<Form>
  <Input
    type="text"
    name="my-input"
  />
  <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
</Form>
```

### With a the fireSubmit function

```jsx
<script>
  let fireSubmit: () => Promise<void>;
</script>

<Form bind:{fireSubmit}>
  <Input type="text" name="my-input"/>
</Form>

<Button on:click={fireSubmit}>Force validation</Button>
```

### With `Form` `id` props and `Button` `form`

```jsx
<Form id="my-exclusive-form">
  <Input type="text" name="my-input"/>
</Form>

<Button form="my-exclusive-form">Submit from outside the form</Button>
```

## Using formfields without Form component

Some times you just what to use some form field alone and not create a full form with validations
and etc. You can do that, the formfields components can handle with context defined by this Form
component, but can work too if the context is not set. However you must handle with validations and
fetch values by your self.

## Creating a custom formfield to use with Form component

Some times you want to extend a formfield component, or create an other completly new. You can do
both.

If you just want create a component to style a formfield, you don't have to handle with this Form
context, just create the component and style it normally. Our formfield will still work normally.

If you want to modify the component behavior, like adding an mask that will change the value you
must handle with the Form context.

If you want to create new formfield component, you must handle with the Form context too.

The documentation can be find at the section bellow.

### Example

We have 3 stories that create:

- [An input example that works with the `Form` component.](?path=/story/components-form--custom-input-example)
- [An submit example that works with the `Form` component.](?path=/story/components-form--custom-button-example)
- [And an usage example.](?path=/story/components-form--custom-usage-example)

## Form context documentation

The form context have the key `"FormContext"`. They define the following functions:

```typescript
/**
 * Set the formfield value
 * @param fieldName the name of the field
 * @param value the value of the field, can be anything, an array, a string
 * @param isvalid true if the value is valid. e.g.: required field + value="", isvalid is false
 */
type setFieldValue = (fieldName: string, value: unknown, isvalid: boolean) => void;
```

```typescript
/**
 * Add the a formfield to the context
 * @param fieldName the name of the field
 * @param value the initial value
 * @param isValid the initial value is valid
 * @param isRequired true if field is required
 * @param htmlElement the most external layer of the component, e.g.: a wrapper div
 * @param forceValidation a function to force the field validate,
 *                        the field must set again the value and isvalid using 'setFieldValue'
 * @param setValue a function to set field value. Used to restore the values saved
 *                 on localStorage on mounted
 */
export type TAddFieldToContext = (
  fieldName: string,
  value: unknown,
  isValid: boolean,
  isRequired: boolean,
  htmlElement: HTMLElement,
  forceValidation: () => void,
  setValue: (value: unknown) => void
) => void;
```

```typescript
/**
 * Remove the formfield from the form context.
 * Use when your formfield component be destroyed
 * @param fieldName the name of the field
 */
type removeFieldFromContext = (fieldName: string) => void;
```

```typescript
/**
 * Dispatch the form submit event.
 * Works like the submit button for defaut html form tag.
 */
type fireSubmit() => void
```

### Dos and Don'ts

✅ Dos

```markdown
- At mounted add the field to the context, with the default props values.
- At destroy, remove component from the context.
- At formfield name change, remove the formfield from the context and add another with the new field
  name.
```

❌ Don'ts

```markdown
- Forget to add the field to the context.
- Set the field value, but not set the isValid.
- Add field to the context on before mount.
- Get the context on mounted.
```
