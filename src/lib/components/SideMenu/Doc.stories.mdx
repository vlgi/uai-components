# SideMenu

This docs is different because side menu have fixed position, and apears above all elements.

The menu is defined as fixed, and because of that the Docs page doens't work very well.

When using this menu you can set you own rule to says when use the desktop and mobile mode.

Be careful with the button and the menu position to not be behind another element.
