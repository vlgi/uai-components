# Szot ui theme and customizations

Szot ui have 2 ways of customization: global theme and custom components. All customization is made with css variables.

If you set the global theme customization, all components will changing accordingly.

You can set any where your custom variables to customize your theme. For example, if you set `--szot-primary: red` at the body component, all components that use primary color will be red. But if in some specific section you set `--szot-primary: blue`, all components inside this section will use primary color as blue, and the rest of the entire web site will keep red as primary. This way you can change the theme with scope.

Some times we want to change some specific component style. Imagine a button that have primary background color, you could change the primary variable only for this component, but the global theme was not maded for this. The global theme allows scope for large modifications, that keep some semantic usage, like the section example above.

For styling the component we export some especific variables, that way you could set variables to change just the color of the button, or they hight, or another thing.

The components customization is documentated at the respective section of the component.

**NOTE: all variables, for global theme or customization of the component, have the prefix `szot`.**

Using svelte there is an elegant way to pass variables to a component, [see svelte style props](https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-component-directives---style-props).
