# Dialog

This component is just a wrapper to add some preset with buttons and dialog logic to the modal.

We use our `Modal` and `Button` components, so you can customize this setting the modal an button
css variables.

For the content, header, and footer, you can change every thing using the slots.

The text color can be customized with the variable: --szot-dialog-text-color,
if not set the default is inherit.

**NOTE: using css variables for the `Button` will change all the buttons inside dialog.**
