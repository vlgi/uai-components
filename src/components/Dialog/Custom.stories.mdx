# Dialog

This component is just a wrapper to add  some preset with buttons and dialog logic to the modal.

We use our `Modal` and `Button` components, so you can customize this setting the modal an button
css variables.

For the content, header, and footer, you can change every thing using the slots.

**NOTE: using css variables for the `Button` will change all the buttons inside dialog.**
